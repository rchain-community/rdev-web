## RCHAIN DEVELOPER COOPERATION 

This is the anti-rivalrous cooperation community. It is composed of communicating developers. Help is needed  organizing in an anti-fragile decentralized manner reflecting the collective intelligence of the members for mutual benefit.


### Overview
RDEV aims to become leaderless cooperation among coop members incubating teams, learning peer to peer, crash courses, bootcamp, meetups, running our own rhobot shard and mainnet validators, crowdfunding, rewarding ourselves, building dapps, helping to make rchain great.


### About RDev
RDev is a workers cooperative structured as a membership association.  It is intended to provide staff and human resources tools and services to allow dApp developers, project managers, dApp investors, and entrepreneurs to connect and collaborate together to build trustworthy decentralized solutions.

Rather than form a legal entity we are electing at this time to be an informal self-management organization. Everyone brings in their own company or themselves having only peer to peer agreements. There is no leader. Instead we employ collective intelligence best practices and collectively develop decentralized governance tools we use ourselves.


### Mission
To empower and support individual developers and teams and help fund their development.


### Goals
- Develop standards and norms needed so our services can work together.
- Cooperatively develop reference implementations of services we all need
- Engaging Members in value production with economic participation
- Fostering the REV and project token marketplaces
- Onboarding members into a decentralized self-management cooperative culture.
- Giving agency (autonomy) to members and teams
- Fostering team formation and cooperative work.
- Providing a pathway to statements of work with the coop and other organizations.
- Giving contributors a stake as credit for their cooperation.
- Learning tech self reliance together while creating value together.
- Building community
- Experimentation with decentralized cooperation at scale.
- Provide services to the cooperation cooperatively.


### Problems 
RChain aims to enable cooperation at scale in a decentralized manner. Our challenge is to enable autonomy and cooperation such that we exhibit a collective intelligence of our members rather than the least common denominator.

There is a virtually unlimited potential of applications moving to RChain. The value of RChain will be determined by the utility of those applications. It is in the interest of developers that other applications succeed as well. They can save immense amounts of effort sharing tools and services with standard interfaces.


### Solutions
- Bring your own project or join an existing one. 
- Connect with other groups such that what you develop is compatible with everything else and you can benefit from the work done by each other. 
- All rchain developers have needs they share with other developers. 
- Together we can solve common problems and create libraries. We can create teams from members and develop apps. 
- We can create standards so our applications can work together, We can run common services rather than each of us running them all ourselves, 
- We can run our own rdev rchain network ultimately to become a mainnet shard for out own work with our own RDEV tokan that might achieve market value if governed well. 
- We can govern ourselves, our teams and cooperations in a decentralized manner using RGOV tools we create.
- We can follow collective intelligence best practices (video) and create things much greater than we can do alone. 
- We can create technology addressing collaboration at scale to address humanities existential issues and populate the galaxy and beyond.
